    <p>
      In January 1978, Harvey Milk became the first openly gay person to be elected to public office
      in California. He did not participate in activism or politics until his 40s,
      prior to which he was a public school teacher, an insurance actuary,
      a stock analyst, and a production associate for Broadway musicals.

      In 2009, President Obama awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom for
      his work in the gay rights movement.

    </h2>
    <p>
      On June 1969 a police raid at a gay bar in New York sparked six days
      of rioting by the gay rights community. The riots led to
      the first Gay Pride marches in U.S. history, which are now held annually
      throughout the world to commemorate the Stonewall riots.

    <h2>Obergefell v. Hodges</h2>

    <p>
      &ldquo;No union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies
      the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice,
      and family. In forming a marital union, two people become
      something greater than once they were. As some of
      the petitioners in these cases demonstrate, marriage
      embodies a love that may endure even past death. It
      would misunderstand these men and women to say they
      disrespect the idea of marriage. Their plea is that they do
      respect it, respect it so deeply that they seek to find its
      fulfillment for themselves. Their hope is not to be condemned
      to live in loneliness, excluded from one of civilizationâ€™s
      oldest institutions. They ask for equal dignity in the
      eyes of the law. The Constitution grants them that right.
    </p>

      The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth
      Circuit is reversed.
