      &ldquo;I have chosen this course which is more difficult and which entails
      more risk and hardship than sitting in jail. I have had to separate myself
      from my dear wife and children, from my mother and sisters to live as an
      outlaw in my own land. I have had to close my business, to abandon my
      profession, and live in poverty, as many of my people are doing&hellip; I shall
      fight the Government side by side with you, inch by inch, and mile by mile,
      until victory is won.
    </p>
    <p>
      What are you going to do?
    </p>
    <p>
      Will you come along with us,
      or are you going to co-operate with the Government in its efforts to suppress
      the claims and aspirations of your own people? Are you going to remain silent
      and neutral in a matter of life and death to my people, to our people? For my
      own part I have made my choice. I will not leave South Africa, nor will I
      surrender. Only through hardship, sacrifice and militant action can freedom
      be won.
    </p>
    <p>
      The struggle is my life. I will continue fighting for freedom until
      the end of my days.&rdquo;

    &ldquo;Over thirty years ago, while still a student, I learned of Mandela
    and the struggles in this land. It stirred something in me. It woke me up
    to my responsibilities - to others, and to myself - and set me on an
    improbable journey that finds me here today.&rdquo;
