    I still need to do my research on Malala, I hear she's a wonderful person, I
    just haven't read any of her writings or heard her speeches except on a few
    talk shows. So, I'm pretty sure I'll want to create a page for her, but it's
    still in construction. Follow <a href="https://twitter.com/goodexhibit" target="_blank">@goodexhibit</a>
    if you would like to be notified when it's finished.
