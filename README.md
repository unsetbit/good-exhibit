# Good Exhibit

> A research project for our class.

## Principles

This is a web application about the good in people.

* The content is important. This is about people and individuals.
* The style is important. Good and bad are always within, take care of how they
are expressed. How the story is told matters as much as the story that is told.
* The medium is important. Leverage the medium to its capacity express style and content. Leverage any and all web technologies you can to serve the style and
content.
* The audience is important. Make it for yourself, friends, family, neighbors, and community. Appeal to emotion and reason: make it fun, interesting, and meaningful.
