      <h3>Liu Xiaobo</h3>
      <p>
        Awarded the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize for his non-violent struggle for human
        rights, Xiaobo is currently imprisoned by China.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Because I had returned from the U.S. to take part in the 1989
        Movement, I was thrown into prison for &lsquo;the crime of counter‑revolutionary
        propaganda and incitement.&rsquo; I also lost my beloved lectern and could no
        longer publish essays or give talks in China. Merely for publishing
        different political views and taking part in a peaceful democracy
        movement, a teacher lost his lectern, a writer lost his right to publish,
        and a public intellectual lost the opportunity to give talks publicly.
        This is a tragedy, both for me personally and for a China that has already
        seen thirty years of Reform and Opening Up.&rdquo;

      <h3>Xu Zhiyong</h3>
      <p>
        A legal activist, seeking government transparency
        and education reform, Zhiyong is currently imprisoned by China.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Freedom, justice and love, these are the spirit of our New Citizens
        Movement, and must become a core value for the Chinese people—for which it
        is up to our generation to fight, sacrifice and assume responsibility. Our
        faith in the idea of building a better China, one of democracy, rule of
        law, freedom, justice, and love, is unwavering. As long as we continue to
        believe in love and the power of hope for a better future, in the desire
        for goodness deep inside every human soul, we will be able to make that
        in which we have faith a reality.
      </p>
      <p>
        Citizens, let us begin now. It does not matter where you are, what jobs you
        have, whether you are poor or rich; let us say in our hearts, in our
        everyday lives, on the internet, on every inch of Chinese land, say with
        conviction and pride that what already belongs to us: I am a citizen,
        we are citizens.
