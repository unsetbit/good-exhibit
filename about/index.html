  <h1>About GOOD EXHIBIT</h1>

  <p>
    Hello, I&apos;m <a target="_blank" href="http://ozan.io">Ozan Turgut</a>,
    I created this website to express what I value. Specifically, my
    role in making this site is building an environment to hold the things
    I value and gluing the important pieces together. As such, any success of
    this website in actually exhibiting something good is primarily attributable
    to those whose works I rely on.
