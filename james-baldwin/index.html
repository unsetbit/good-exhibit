    <p>
      James Baldwin's examination in 1953 of the role of the Christian
      Church in the lives of African Americans, Go Tell It on the Mountain,
      is ranked as one of the best English-language novels of the 20th
      century.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through his life, Baldwin befriended icons such as Marlon Brando, Malcolm X,
      Nina Simone, Martin Luther King, Maya Angelou, and Toni Morrison.
      Shortly before his death, he was given France's highest honor, La Légion D’Honneur.

      You knew, didn't you, how I needed your language and the mind that formed it?
    </p>
    <p>
      How I relied on your fierce courage to tame wildernesses for me?
    </p>
    <p>
      How strengthened I was by the certainty that came from knowing you would never hurt me?
    </p>
    <p>
      You knew, didn't you, how I loved your love?
    </p>
    <p>
      You knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      This then is no calamity. No.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is jubilee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our crown,&rdquo; you said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;has already been bought and paid for. All we have to do,&rdquo; you said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;is wear it.&rdquo;
