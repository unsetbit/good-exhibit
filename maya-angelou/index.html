    <h1 style="font-size: 53px;">Maya Angelou, poet</h1>
    <p>
      You may write me down in history<br>
      With your bitter, twisted lies,<br>
      You may tread me in the very dirt<br>
      But still, like dust, I'll rise.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Does my sassiness upset you? <br>
      Why are you beset with gloom? <br>
      'Cause I walk like I've got oil wells<br>
      Pumping in my living room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just like moons and like suns,<br>
      With the certainty of tides,<br>
      Just like hopes springing high,<br>
      Still I'll rise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Did you want to see me broken? <br>
      Bowed head and lowered eyes? <br>
      Shoulders falling down like teardrops.<br>
      Weakened by my soulful cries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Does my haughtiness offend you? <br>
      Don't you take it awful hard<br>
      'Cause I laugh like I've got gold mines<br>
      Diggin' in my own back yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may shoot me with your words,<br>
      You may cut me with your eyes,<br>
      You may kill me with your hatefulness,<br>
      But still, like air, I'll rise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Does my sexiness upset you? <br>
      Does it come as a surprise<br>
      That I dance like I've got diamonds<br>
      At the meeting of my thighs?
    </p>
    <p>
      Out of the huts of history's shame<br>
      I rise<br>
      Up from a past that's rooted in pain<br>
      I rise<br>
      I'm a black ocean, leaping and wide,<br>
      Welling and swelling I bear in the tide.<br>
      Leaving behind nights of terror and fear<br>
      I rise<br>
      Into a daybreak that's wondrously clear<br>
      I rise<br>
      Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave,<br>
      I am the dream and the hope of the slave.<br>
      I rise<br>
      I rise<br>
      I rise.

      &ldquo;She touched me, she touched all of you, she touched people all
      across the globe, including a young white woman from Kansas who
      named her daughter after Maya and raised her son to be the first
