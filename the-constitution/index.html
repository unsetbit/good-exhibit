    <h1 style="font-size: 75px;">The Constitution</h1>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prior to the adoption of the Federal Constitution, the Articles of
  Confederation, drafted by the Continental Congress and approved
  by 13 States, provided for a union of the former British colonies.
  Even before Maryland became the last State to accede to the Articles
  in 1781, a number of Americans, particularly those involved in
  the prosecution of the Revolutionary War, recognized the inadequacies
  of the Articles as a national government. In the 1780s these
  nationally-minded Americans became increasingly disturbed by the
  Articlesâ€™ failure to provide the central government with authority
  to raise revenue, regulate commerce, or enforce treaties.&rdquo;
